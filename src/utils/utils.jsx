      'The world is undergoing rapid changes in the knowledge landscape. With various dramatic scientificand technological advances, such as the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence,many unskilled jobs worldwide may be taken over by machines, while the need for a skilledworkforce, particularly involving mathematics, computer science, and data science, in conjunctionwith multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, will beincreasingly in greater demand. With climate change, increasing pollution, and depleting naturalresources, there will be a sizeable shift in how we meet the world’s energy, water, food, andsanitation needs, again resulting in the need for new skilled labour, particularly in biology, chemistry,physics, agriculture, climate science, and social science. The growing emergence of epidemics andpandemics will also call for collaborative research in infectious disease management anddevelopment of vaccines and the resultant social issues heightens the need for multidisciplinarylearning. There will be a growing demand for humanities and art, as India moves towards becoming adeveloped country as well as among the three largest economies in the world.',
